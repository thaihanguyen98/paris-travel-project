            <p>
              Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global
              center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century
              cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine.
              Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century,
              Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe
              culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg
              Saint-Honor√©.
